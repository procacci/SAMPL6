Method: 

All simulations were performed with the ORAC6.0 program using the fast
switching double annihilation method with no restraints.  (doi:
10.1039/c5cp05521k). In the REST stage (Replica exchange with solute
tempering) we scaled the torsional ad 14 non bonded interactions of
the solute (host+guest) up to 0.1 (i.e. 3000 K) using 8 replicas with
the scaling protocol described in 10.1002/jcc.21388. Average exchange
rate was 30%. The REST simulations lasted (per replica state) 30 ns
sampling about 400 configurations for the bound host-guest state and
for the free guest.  In the bound state, a weak COM-COM harmonic
tethering potential (k=0.0266 kcal mol-1 Angs^2 ) was imposed to prevent
the guest to drifting off in the solvent. In the FS-DAM stage, the
guest, both in the bound and unbound state, was annihilated in 0.36 ns
in 400 independent annihilation trajectories starting form the points
sampled in the REST stage.

The FF parameters (bonded, charges and LJ) and topology of the host
and guests molecules were prepared using the priamdorac interface (
doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145) .  Primadorac uses GAFF2 and AM1/BCC
charges.  All carboxylate groups were assumed to be deprotonated. No
counterions were used.  A background neutralizing plasma was assumed
within the PBC Ewald method (PME). Each system was solvated with ~1300
water molecules in a cubic box of ~34 sidelenght. A finite size correction due to 
net charges has been calculated as described in DOI: 10.1063/1.477788.   
  
Production REM and FS-DAM simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperature
control (T=298 K) using Nose-Hoover thermostat and pressure control
(P=1 atm) provided a Parrinello-Rhaman barostat with cubic
constraints. Direct space nonbonded interactions were truncated with a
13.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range electrostatics were handled
with the PME method using alpha=0.37 and 1 Angs grid spacing in the
direct space.  SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds involving
hydrogen atoms, and the simulation was integrated using a five step RESPA
integrator as described in DOI:10.1021/jp960295w.  Error on DG
(gaussian unbiased estimate) was computed by bootstrapping samples of
40 works out of the collection of 400.
